Today I need to work on these things:

1. [[Overall Tab]]
1. [[Category field]]
	- In UI, we would need to have 3 columns - Wine, Spirits, Beer - One or two more maybe. Shouldn't be that hard.
	- In backend, we can access the columns, since we are joining the Sku table. Then I think we could go through every row and make one column instead off 3.
1. UI bug
	- Need to take Rashmi's help to solve this bug. Shouldn't take much time IMO.
2. Any bugs that come up while testing.

I can't do all this on my own, I would require help - a good amount of it.
