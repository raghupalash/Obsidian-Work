I'm free today and waiting for the instructions on the next task.

Meanwhile, I shouldn't waste time I think following tasks can be done - 

1. Connecting these obsidian notes with my personal Github and updating the notes there.
2. Trying that vim configuration again.
3. Configuring Sonarqube to run as a service.
