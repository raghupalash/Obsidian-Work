So today, we need to get done with the table ASAP - and get started with integrating Supplier and Category as well.

This is what we need to do in the table:
- Make it work for entity too.
	- Would need to change the backend for this. - Float key issue. Entity Type issue in results function. - 1 hr.
	- Lots of columns for entities. How to resolve that?
- Need to add brand to row/columns as well - 10-15 minutes
- Make it work for both 2d and 3d scenerios. - lots of repeated if-else in "columns:" fields. Might result in bugs, testing would be required too for different scenerios. We'll also need to do different things to get the names of the things (o.brand for brand, and o.name for somethintg else for eg.) - 3 hours
- resolve table bugs. - 1-2 hours
- Think about how we are going to add overall as well (maybe later) - would require us to do some table operations.
