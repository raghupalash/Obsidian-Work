# Store Breakdown Report - Search is not working

In the Store breakdown report, the search by Merchant name is not working. No API was also triggered.

Seems like a plugin is in place for this feature.

I think there might be some bug in naming which is not letting the correct behavior to happen.

line no. 2 in pricepulse_availability_report.js:
`const storeBreakdownPage = 'storeBreakdownPage';`

Which means, it does something to the store breakdown page. It also contains a Merchant table which I think might be interacting with the merchant table of the aforementioned page. But why it isn't included in the html?
